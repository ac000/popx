A simple command line tool to accessing POP3 mailbox's.

E.g connect to your POP3 server

	./popx 10.0.5.5 me@example.com

Where me@example.com is the username for the account. It will then prompt
for the password (with echo turned off).

Upon connecting it will give you a list of your messages (there's no in app
paging) e.g you will see something like

+OK Mailbox open, 4 messages

You can then issue commands such as TOP n, RETR n, DELE n etc. Commands are
not case sensitive.

exit to finish.

Useful for looking at that crufty old POP3 account that you don't want to
go through all the trouble of setting up in your mail client

Ultimately it should behave a bit more like the mailx program.
