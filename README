A simple command line tool to accessing POP3 mailbox's.

Currently just connects you to your POP3 account and lets you issue POP3
commands.

	./popx 10.0.5.5 me@example.com

Where me@example.com is the username for the account. It will then prompt
for the password (with echo turned off).

You can then issue commands such as LIST, TOP n, RETR n etc. Commands are
not case sensitive.

exit to finish.

Useful to looking at that crufty old POP3 account that you don't want to
go through all the trouble of setting up in your mail client

Currently you need to use the IP address rather than hostname.

Ultimately it should behave a bit more like the mailx program.
